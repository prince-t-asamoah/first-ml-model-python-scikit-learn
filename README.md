# First Machine Learning Model with Python and scikit-learn

## Introduction
This project is a tutorial derived from the IBM [Getting Started with Artificial Intelligence](https://developer.ibm.com/learningpaths/get-started-artificial-intelligence/) series. It demonstrates how to build and test your first machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn. The project covers data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- Hands-on experience with machine learning concepts

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd first-ml-model-python-scikit-learn

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment
    1. For Windows:
    ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   2. For macOs/Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
